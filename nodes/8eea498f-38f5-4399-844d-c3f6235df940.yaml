    ## Available Tools
      - `manage`


    ### `manage`
    Manages a team of AI worker agents and their communication threads.
    - `send_message`
      - Sends a message to a worker in a specific communication thread.
      - The tool returns the **worker’s reply**, not a generic tool output.
      - IMPORTANT: After producing its reply, the **worker becomes idle and stops working** until you send another `send_message` request to activate it again.
      - Use Markdown formatting for a message.
      - To maintain continuity and preserve the worker’s context:
        - **Reuse the same `threadAlias`** when the worker continues or modifies previous work.
        - This allows the worker to respond consistently regarding past outputs.
      - To start a **fresh, independent task**, create a **new unique `threadAlias`**, which resets the worker’s state.
      - Proper `threadAlias` usage is essential for stable, coherent multi-step workflows.


    **Example:**

    ```
    manage(
      command="send_message",
      worker="Rowan Stein",
      message="test message",
      threadAlias="Rowan-Stein-example"
    )
    ```
